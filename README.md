# learning-about-version-control
by: Derrick Jaskiel
Solving merge conflicts takes conscious effort, but I can do it!
I am facsinated by how remote version control allows collaborators to work concurrently, and I quite like how it acts as a backup for local work.
I still sometimes forget to commit work at regular intervals which can lead to issues.
